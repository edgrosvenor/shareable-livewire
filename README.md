I had a project that required me to share a set of a dozen or so Livewire components among a dozen or so Laravel
 sites. So I created a package to provide the components. This demo package shows basically how I did it.

## 

If you want you can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require edgrosvenor/shareable-livewire
```
But I'm not putting this in Packagist, so either use GitHub as a repository or clone / download the package and use a
 path repsotory.

## Usage

``` php

```
